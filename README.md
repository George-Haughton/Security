# Security

### What are the risks?
One of the most common risks are viruses, which everyone has had some sort of experience with at some point. A virus is piece of code which has the ability to copy itself which can have huge negative effects on your system; for example destroying data or corrupting the system. A worm is a type of malware computer program which replicates itself so it van spread around your computer. It will use faults in the network and will continuously replicate itself, they do not change or delete files like a virus but most of the time they will cause some sort of network harm even if it is creating a huge amount of bandwidth.

### Who are the risks?

Where there are system risks that will occur online or within the system there are security risks that occur within the company. For example most big hacking or leaks of any kind are done by employees on the inside. Companies do not realize that they have staff giving away information or giving hackers ways into their networks and systems either for money/bribes, recongition or for enjoyment. Which means companies need to make sure their employees are checked out and go through excersizes to prevent businesses from hiring staff that can put the business at risk. Additionlly, without giving out information staff can still be a huge threat to the organisation but being unprofessional when it comes to physical security measures and not taking them seriously. A few examples are letting in people into the building without knowing them, asking them for ID of any kind to prove they are allowed in the building; leaving doors that are meant to be locked at all times open. This runs the risk of again people getting into the building that could cause harm to the business. Lastly, clicking onlinks or visiting websites without thinking of the risks that come with, like accidentally downloading a virus onto their business computer which then spreads to the servers and to other computers putting the business at risk.

### Threats to an organisation
There are many threats an organisation faces, that can either be software or human based problems. The main one which every business or company fears is hacking, which can disrupt a companies day to day running if thats something like not being able to access the company email account or if the hackers shut down the company website. Additionally, hackers can shut down the companies's app which can cost huge amounts to get back online or to repair it, and as the app is offline the company misses out and loses hundreds, or even thousands of pounds. Secondly, a threat which not many people think of is their employees. Employees are a huge week spot of every business as these employees hold huge amounts of valuable information about the business; such as passwords, account details, customer information and various other precious information. For example if an employee is approached by an organisation that would like to threaten, bribe, or buy this information off of said employee, all it would take for the employee to be in a bad mood or to not get on well with the manager or boss; and the employee would happily give away this valuable information jeopardizing the company's reputation, profits and the health of the business in general. This is why when companies give this information to any employee they need to be 100% sure they can trust their staff to not give out this information. Thirdly, in this day of age every company will use a good amount of technology, hardware and software which we all expect to protect our data, work and important documents. Everything piece of technology has its downsides that we as humans cannot control we can reduce the risk of it happening but in the end we cannot be 100% sure the piece of software or piece of technology will be fully secure and run perfectly. When technology crashes or bugs out it can have huge affects on the running of a company. For example companies will store important infromation/files on machine hard drives which only a few members within the company will have access to which they can add to, edit or delete if they so wish to; but if the hard drives crash they run the risk of any information corrupting or deleting which could cost the company huge amounts of money to recover, and sometimes they cannot get these files back which negatively affect the company as a whole. Also when important files are lost the amount of work put into these files are a total waste of time as they is no proof any work was done which i huge waste of money when these important documents are lost. Resulting in loss of profits and/or essential files that the company need to stay afloat and survive.
